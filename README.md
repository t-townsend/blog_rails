# Blog in Rails

This website was built in Ruby on Rails, and was an assignment while I was at
CodeCore for the full stack developer bootcamp. It allows the user to sign in or
sign up, and when this is done, the user can add comments on the posts or create
new posts. There is built in functionality to upload an image for the cover of
the post, and for the user's avatar. Right now it is seeded with filler text,
which will change when other bugs are fixed. The app also has a mailer function,
which emails the user when another user comments on their post. This is a RESTful
app with CRUD used on the posts and comments. There is a liking function, which
is a work in progress, which uses AJAX calls to update the page, so it doesn't
refresh completely.

**Technologies Used: Ruby on Rails, Postgres, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, AJAX**
